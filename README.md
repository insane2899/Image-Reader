# Image-Reader
This is a project made in Java 11 and Swing. 
The idea of the project came to me as I had image binarization as a part of my college 2nd Year Project. While reviewing the 
different techniques by sauvola and niblack and others I faced severe trouble owing to the lack of any application which will 
generate the binarized images according to input value (atleast I don't know any such application and I searched a lot 
<bold><strong>(A LOT)</strong></bold>)
Anyway to use this project one must have <strong>Tesseract OCR</strong> installed and added into Java IDE you use.
Now about the project:

On running the project the first page that comes is:
